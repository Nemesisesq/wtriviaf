A basic react native app with [`react-native-firebase`](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase) pre-integrated  to get you started quickly.

## Getting Started

If you're only developing for one platform you can ignore the steps below that are tagged with the platform you don't require.

### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

- 1.1) `git clone https://gitlab.com/invertase/react-native-firebase-starter-auth.git`
- 1.2) `cd react-native-firebase-starter-auth` - cd into your newly created project directory.
- 1.3) Install NPM packages with your package manager of choice - i.e run `yarn` or `npm install`
- 1.4) **[iOS]** `cd ios` and run `pod install` - if you don't have CocoaPods you can follow [these instructions](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started) to install it.
- 1.5) **[Android]** No additional steps for android here.

### 2) Rename Project

**You will need to be running Node verison 7.6 or greater for the rename functionality to work**

- 2.0) **[iOS]** `cd ..` to return to the root directory of the project
- 2.1) `npm run rename` - you'll be prompted to enter a project name and company name
- 2.2) Note down the package name value - you'll need this when setting up your Firebase project

### 3) Add `Google Services` files (plist & JSON)

- 3.1) **[iOS]** Follow the `add firebase to your app` instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app) to generate your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file if you haven't done so already - use the package name generated previously as your `iOS bundle ID`.
- 3.2) **[iOS]** Place this file in the `ios/` directory of your project.
- 3.3) **[Android]** Follow the `manually add firebase` to your app instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase) to generate your `google-services.json` file if you haven't done so already - use the package name generated previously as your `Android package name`.
- 3.4) Place this file in the `android/app/` directory of your project.
